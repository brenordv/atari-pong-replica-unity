# Pong! Replica

Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise and I created this replica for the same reason.

Pong was the first commercially successful video game, and it helped to establish the video game industry along with the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that closely mimicked its gameplay. Eventually, Atari's competitors released new types of video games that deviated from Pong's original format to varying degrees, and this, in turn, led Atari to encourage its staff to move beyond Pong and produce more innovative games themselves.

# Current features
There's currently only one type of game: Player vs Player - best out of three.
When the game is over, press ```return``` (or button zero on a controller) to reset.

# TODO
1. Add start menu
2. Add AI so I can play this singleplayer
